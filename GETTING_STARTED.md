## ðŸŽ¨ Customization

### Replace the Profile Image
Simply add your photo as `public/profile.jpg` (or `.png`)

The site will automatically use it instead of the placeholder!

### Adjust Colors
Edit `src/style.css` and modify the CSS variables:

```css
:root {
  --color-accent: #2c5aa0;        /* Your main blue */
  --color-accent-dark: #1e3a6f;   /* Darker blue for hover */
  --color-warm: #eab308;          /* Brass accent */
  --color-warm-light: #fbbf24;    /* Lighter brass */
}
```

### Optional: Add Background Images
Add photos to `public/images/`:
- `literature.jpg` - Books or reading setup
- `music.jpg` - Your guitar or music space
- `collecting.jpg` - Fountain pens or watches
- `gaming.jpg` - Gaming setup or controllers

The styles are ready - just add the images!

### Modify Descriptions
Edit `src/App.vue` around lines 210-255 to update:
- Expertise descriptions
- Personal interest descriptions
- Any text content
